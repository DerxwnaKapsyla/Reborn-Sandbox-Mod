# Pokemon Reborn: Sandbox Mod
Pokemon Reborn: Sandbox Mod is a mod for Episode 19 of Pokemon Reborn. Developed by DerxwnaKapsyla and picked up Waynolt, the mod's primary purpose is to allow players to custom tailor their games to suit their needs, whatever those needs may be.

This repository only contains the relevant files for the Sandbox Mod and nothing else.

# Installation
Upon downloading the .zip file from releases, open the download and extract its contents into your Pokemon Reborn folder. Everything should sort itself properly and correctly.

# How To Use
It works slightly differently from before. Initially, I had an NPC in the Grand Hall and Agate Circus who would take you there. However, you can now access the Sandbox Zone from any PC. Exiting it requires interacting with another PC, which'll take you back to your previous location.

# Features
 - (Almost) Every item is purchasable from an NPC.
 - A Nurse
 - A Sketch Setup Trainer
 - An EV Grinding Trainer
 - An IV manipulating NPC
 - A Specific Pokemon Generator NPC
 - A Fill Box with Every Pokemon NPC
 - An infinite ATM bound to the Sandbox PC
 - Blue Moon Lemonade
 - The Pokemon Psychologist from 7th Street
 - The Breeder
 - The Relearner
 - The Move Deleter
 - The Name Rater
 - An NPC that gives you a 31^6 IV Ditto w/ Pokerus
 - Every Move Tutor
 - A Core Assembler for Zygarde
 - A Form Selector for Deoxys
 - A Form Selector for Rotom
 - My own OC as a battle because why not
 - On top of that it comes with the foundation for a custom trainer loader that works separately from trainers.txt and trainertypes.txt that'll (eventually) be in the Mod Loader.
 

# uhhh idk what else should I put here?
The game is literally over 160 hours long I do not have the time nor patience to test every possible interaction with items you might get early if you purchase them or the ability to warp to and from Sandbox at points where you shouldn't be able to (Hi PULSE Hypno). If you find any bugs or issues, PLEASE report them to me and/or Waynolt and we'll look into them as soon as we're able. Unless you're ABSOLUTELY sure it's not Sandbox-related, **DO NOT REPORT THEM TO AMETHYST, CASS, _ANYBODY_ ON THE REBORN DEVELOPMENT TEAM. THEY WILL LOOK AT YOU FUNNY AND I WILL CRY.**
